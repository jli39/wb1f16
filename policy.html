          <div class="inner-cover">
          <h1 class="cover-heading">Policies</h1>
          <p><strong>Attendance Policy:</strong>&nbsp; Students are required to attend 
       each and every lecture.&nbsp; Attendance and active participation during 
  lectures will help you learn the material and succeed in class.&nbsp; Missed 
  lectures will negatively impact your ability to make sense of the materials 
  covered in subsequent lectures.</p>
    <p>The instructor may sometimes take attendance. When an attendance sheet 
    is passed around put your name only on the attendance sheet.</p>
    <p><strong>Absence Policy:</strong> It is the student’s responsibility to 
    promptly notify the instructor about an absence prior to the missed class 
    session and discuss with the instructor how to fulfill academic 
    responsibilities. Notification should be provided in writing or e-mail.</p>
    <p>While classes are conducted on the premise that regular attendance is 
    expected, the university recognizes certain activities and events as 
    legitimate reasons for absence from class.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Illness or Injury - In the event of an absence due to illness or 
      injury, verification from the medical professional treating the 
      illness or injury preventing the student from attendance during class 
      time should be presented to the instructor when the student returns to 
      class. Dates in which the student was diagnosed and may return to 
      class should be present on the verification. Students should discuss 
      with the faculty member how to fulfill their academic responsibilities 
      while coping with their illness or injury. *University Health Services 
      (UHS) does not provide excuses for students who miss a class, exam, 
      presentation or other academic responsibility due to illness or 
      injury. UHS Walk-Out Statements are not accepted as verification.</li>
      <li>School Sponsored Event - Students who anticipate absences due to a 
      school sponsored event or participation in an approved concert or 
      athletic event should present a "Class Absence Authorization Form" 
      identifying absences and identifying the event sponsor’s name and 
      contact information to instructor before the end of the second week of 
      the semester.</li>
      <li>Other - Other legitimate reasons for class absence include death 
      in the immediate family, or religious observance. Students should 
      provide legitimate verification of participation in/attendance at the 
      aforementioned events.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Missed Class Policy</strong>: It is up to the student to make 
    up any missed material. If class is missed it is best to get notes from a 
    fellow student (who has taken good notes). This will be the best record of 
    what transpired during the class meeting. Sometimes, in response to 
    questions or as seems beneficial, further explanation will spontaneously 
    be created by the instructor and written on the board. The instructor may 
    retain no written record of this.</p>
    <p><strong>Handwriting Policy</strong>: All handwritten work must be 
    legible to the instructor and grader. This includes not writing using tiny 
    characters. Unreadable (by the instructor) work will not be graded and the 
    points will be lost.</p>
    <p><strong>Extra Credit Policy</strong>: There is no extra credit.</p></div>

          <div class="inner-cover">
          <h1 class="cover-heading">Miscellaneous</h1>
          <p>Please remember that personal conversation during lecture time is distracting 
 to the instructor and to your fellow students. Leave the class if your wish to 
  converse (on the phone). Discussions with your instructor regarding individual 
  matters may be conducted after the class, but NOT before or DURING the class 
  time please. If you must leave class early or arrive late - Please do so 
 discreetly.&nbsp; Please silence all phones, beepers, pagers, radios, laptops 
 and any other noise making devises. Laptops are acceptable for taking notes; 
 however, please ensure that your sound is turned off and that the screen does 
 not distract/block other students.</p>
    <p>Read the text. Only general reading assignments will be given. The class will mostly cover material in the same order as the text book, there may be exceptions however. It is the student's responsibility to maintain an awareness of the material in the text that is currently being covered.&nbsp; Ask the instructor if you are unsure of the text material currently being covered.</p>
    <p>The instructor may occasionally address a student in class by her/his first name. If you do not want this for yourself notify the instructor in person AND by email.</p>
    <p>The syllabus be modified during the semester if it is necessary. The changes will be added in blue, and pointed out in class. Any changes will be for clarification, the grade calculation as described above, is fixed.</p>
    <p>Using e-cigarettes in class is not permitted.</p>
    <p>See my web pages (www address above) for additional information, handouts, programming assignments, etc.</p>
    <p>If you have any problems, including understanding the material that we cover in class or using the computer, please talk to me.</p</div>
